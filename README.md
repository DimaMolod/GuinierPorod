# GuinierPorod
Generalized Guinier-Porod model

Generalized Guinier-Porod approximation to evaluate d, s, Q1, Rg where d is a Porod exponent and s is the parameter that gives information about the nonsphericity of particles in solution. For three-dimensional globular objects s = 0, for rods s = 1, and for lamellae (or platelets) s = 2. A Porod exponent d = 4 reveals particles with smooth surfaces while d = 3 indicates rough surfaces. An exponent d = 2 can represent scattering either from Gaussian polymer chains or from a two-dimensional structure. An exponent d = 1 represents scattering from a stiff rod (or thin cylinder). Porod exponents less than 3 correspond to ‘‘mass fractals’’ while Porod exponents between 3 and 4 describe ‘‘surface fractals’’.
